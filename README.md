# DOM-Final-Project

Explanations of the technologies used:
In this project - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used throughout the Document Object Model(DOM). For the project, there were 10 HTML pages create, one main index.html page that linked to the second HTML page associated in a different folder(Pages folder). That was linked through an a href to the next page etc... CSS used flexbox was used to center the content of the div container and create space between the divs.

Motivation:
The motivation for this project was my love for Disneyland, BabyYoda, and coding. These three combined, make it a very memorable process.

Coding Style:
Standard JavaScript, HTML, & CSS Use of the DOM

Approach taken:
The approach was honestly a little challenging. Going through different ideas and concepts. I first started with my HTML and outlined how I wanted the project to be structured. I created an HTML structure for each one of my HTML pages and linked them to the next. Broke down each part of my HTML page into different divs.

Approach for my JS:
Created two objects and instantiated them. Created an object for each of the strings (that are associated with an HTML page) Created an if/else statement that allows if one button is clicked the next one will not show for HTML page 5. Accessed a variable from HTML to JS (DOM), in order to make the addEventListner active with the HTML pages. Styled the text/text2 variable in JS.
With the JS, I first outlined how I wanted the project to act/interact with the user. I was able to get the button to click and the image to appear using the className property and CSS to create this effect. I first used toggle, and it was extremely helpful, but I noticed an issue. The user could toggle again and the image would disappear. Using className it set the value I wanted.

Features:
Features of this project are the use of addEventListeners. Creating an addEventListeners allowed me to make the buttons actually function when "Clicked". Since having two buttons for each page, I was able to make only two addEventListners, rather than one for each page for each button.

Unsolved problems:
One unsolved problem is that my HTML pages start from the beginning of the code each time it runs. They are linked from one to the next one but do not memorize each page. That is my focus to figure out which will be one of my stretch goals.
