# DOM-Final-Project

Explanations of the technologies used:
In this project - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used throught the Document Object Model(DOM). 
For the project there were 10 HTML pages create, one main index.html page that linked to the second HTML page associated in a differe folder(Pages folder). That was linked through an a href to the next page etc...
CSS used flexbox to order the text, images and button to place them center and in a column form. 

Motivation
The motivation for this project was my love for DisneyLand/BabyYoda, and coding. There three combineded, make it a very memorable process. 

Approach taken:
The approach was honestly alittle challanging. Going throuugh different ideas and concepts. 
I first started with my HTML, outlined how I wanted the project to be structured. 
I create an HTML structure for each one of my HTML pages and linked then to the next. I first created one div for all the items, and soon realized I needed to break it into
pieces. Once I did that the project followed better. 

With the JS, I first outlined how I wanted the project to act/interact with the user. My biggest goal was to get the button to click and the image to appear. I first used toggle, 
it was extremely helpful, but I noticed an issue. The user could toggle again and the image would disappear. I wanted the image to stay in place once click.

Approach for my JS: to to create two objects, 
created an object for each of the string(that are associated with an HTML page) 
Created an if/else statment that allow if one button is clicked it will only appear on of the next buttons are on page
5 of my HTML
Accessed a variable from  HTML to JS (DOM), in order make the addListner active with the HTML pages. 
Styled the text/text2 varaible in JS. 

Features
What I feel that makes the project stand out is spefically the us of JS. Creating an addEventLisnter allowed me to make the buttons actually function when "Clicked". 
Since having two buttons for each pages, I was able to make only two addEventListners, rather than one for each page for each button.

Unsolved problems:
One unsolved problem was that my HTML pages start from beggingin of the code each time its ran. They are link from one to the next one,
but does not memeorized each page. That is my focused to figure out for my stretch goals.
